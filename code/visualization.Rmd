## Create spatial objects

# create spatial points object for each sensor
PA_sensors = SpatialPoints(AQ_df[!duplicated(AQ_df$ID), c("Lon", "Lat")],proj4string = CRS(prg))
summary(PA_sensors)

# construct spatiotemporal object
PA_STFDF = stConstruct(AQ_df, space = c("Lon","Lat"), time = "datetime", crs = CRS(prg), SpatialObj = sensors)

# turn ST object into a STFDF (stationary points)
PA_STFDF = as(PA_STFDF,"STFDF")

# see summary of data
summary(PA_STFDF)
# object class
class(PA_STFDF)
# object dimensions
dim(PA_STFDF)
```

# Kriging
## Funky Data from Variograms
After running through this kriging methodology without removing any data points, there were a few sensors that had very strange values when looking through the variograms. This prompted me to plot them individually and examine the actual PM2.5 values for the fire period, to see if any of them seemed unreasonable. Both the Eisenhower Dr and 1333 Wildwood Ct sensors have values that are far too high, so those are dropped for our analysis done below.
```{r}
# Index 15 -> ID 60517, STANDLEY LAKE
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$ID == 60517]["2021-12-30::2022-01-02", "corrected_pm"]))
# looks normal

# Index 23 -> ID 91877, Eisenhower Dr
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$ID == 91877]["2021-12-30::2022-01-02", "corrected_pm"]))
# has incredibly large values midday Friday - Sunday, could be snow related?

# Index 36 -> ID 112606, 1333 Wildwood Ct., Boulder, CO 80305 sensor
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$ID == 112606]["2021-12-30::2022-01-02", "corrected_pm"]))
# looking at purpleair map, A channel is 'downgraded', 0% confidence

# Index 40 -> ID 119547, Broadlands sensor
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$ID == 119547]["2021-12-30::2022-01-02", "corrected_pm"]))
# reasonable values
```


Looking at Dec 30 - Jan 2, only outside sensors.
```{r warning=FALSE}
# get all of the data for the 12/30 to 1/2 timeframe
krig_data <- complete_STFDF[,"2021-12-30::2022-01-02"]
# limit to only outdoor sensors
krig_data <- krig_data[krig_data@data$Location == "outside"]
# drop sensor 112606 (Wildwood Ct) because it has 0% confidence according to PurpleAir map
krig_data <- krig_data[krig_data@data$ID != 112606]
# drop values for "Eisenhower Dr" sensor that are over 1000
krig_data@data[(krig_data@data$ID == 91877) &
                 (as.numeric(krig_data@data$corrected_pm) > 1000) &
                 !is.na(krig_data@data$corrected_pm),]$corrected_pm <- NA
# get rid of the weird sensor that might be throwing residuals off
#krig_data <- krig_data[krig_data@data$Name != "ntsky"]

# reproject the data to utm
reproj <- "+proj=utm +zone=13 +datum=WGS84 +units=km"
krig_data@sp <- spTransform(krig_data@sp, reproj)

# aggregate from 10 min intervals to 1 hour intervals

# split the data into the days we want for the fire period

dec31 <- krig_data[, "2021-12-31"]
jan1 <- krig_data[, "2022-01-01"]
jan2 <- krig_data[, "2022-01-02"]

# split each day into the time periods of focus
# pre-fire period: betweeen 00:00 - 11:00 MST on 12/30/2021
pre_fire <- aggregate(dec30, by="11 hours", mean)[, "2021-12-30 00:00:00"]
# fire period (11am - 5pm)
during_fire <- aggregate(dec30[, "2021-12-30 11:00:00::2021-12-30 16:00:00"], by="6 hours", mean)
# post-fire on 12/30/2021
evening_of_fire <- aggregate(dec30[, "2021-12-30 16:00:00::2021-12-31 00:00:00"], by="8 hours", mean)
# dec 31st
december31 <- aggregate(dec31, by="day", mean)
# january 1st

periods <- c(pre_fire, during_fire, evening_of_fire, december31, january1, january2)

# create variograms for these time periods
pre_fire.vgm <- variogram(corrected_pm~1, pre_fire[!is.na(pre_fire$corrected_pm),])
during_fire.vgm <- variogram(corrected_pm~1, during_fire[!is.na(during_fire$corrected_pm),])

### Variogram Clouds
```{r}
for (period in periods) {
  cloud <- variogram(corrected_pm~1, period[!is.na(period$corrected_pm), ], cloud=TRUE)
  map <- variogram(corrected_pm~1, period[!is.na(period$corrected_pm), ], map=TRUE, cutoff=20, width=2)
  print(plot(cloud))
  print(plot(map))
}

```


No good variogram models!!!!

We're going to try autofitting variograms & models to the variograms to see if this returns anything different than above.
```{r}

pre_fire.fitted <- fit.variogram(pre_fire.vgm, vgm(c("Exp", "Sph", "Gau", "Mat")))
pre_fire.fitted

plot(pre_fire.vgm, model=pre_fire.fitted)

during_fire.fitted <- fit.variogram(during_fire.vgm, vgm(c("Exp", "Sph", "Gau", "Mat")))
during_fire.fitted

plot(during_fire.vgm, model=during_fire.fitted)

evening_of_fire.fitted <- fit.variogram(evening_of_fire.vgm, vgm(c("Exp", "Sph", "Gau", "Mat")))
evening_of_fire.fitted

plot(evening_of_fire.vgm, model=evening_of_fire.fitted)

december31.fitted <- fit.variogram(december31.vgm, vgm(c("Exp", "Sph", "Gau", "Mat")))
december31.fitted

plot(december31.vgm, model=december31.fitted)

january1.fitted <- fit.variogram(january1.vgm, vgm(c("Exp", "Sph", "Gau", "Mat")))
january1.fitted

plot(january1.vgm, model=january1.fitted)

january2.fitted <- fit.variogram(january2.vgm, vgm(c("Exp", "Sph", "Gau", "Mat")))
january2.fitted

plot(january1.vgm, model=january2.fitted)
```

These models are no good (some can't even find models), so kriging isn't going to be working with this data.

### Breaking down into smaller timeframes
Let's see if things look different when we examine each hour, instead of aggregating into ~6 hour periods.
```{r}
for (i in 0:11) {
  if (i < 10) {
    i <- paste("0", i, sep="")
  }
  t <- paste("2021-12-30 ", i, ":00:00", sep="")
  i.data <- dec30[, t]
  i.vgm <- variogram(corrected_pm~1, i.data[!is.na(i.data$corrected_pm),])
  # print(plot(i.vgm, main=paste("Variogram at", t)))
  i.fitted <- fit.variogram(i.vgm, vgm(c("Exp", "Sph", "Gau", "Mat")))
  print(i.fitted)
  print(plot(i.vgm, model=i.fitted, main=paste("Variogram at", t)))
}
```

Still no good variograms!

## Making grid for interpolation
We create a 50x50 grid for interpolation. This results in the resolution being 0.009372036 km wide by 0.007888942 km tall.
```{r}
grd <- SpatialPixels(SpatialPoints(as_Spatial(st_make_grid(all_bounds, n=50))), proj4string = prg)
plot(grd)

grd <- grd[as_Spatial(all_bounds),]
plot(grd)

grd <- spTransform(grd, CRS(reproj))
```

## Plotting Corrected PM

This is just used to check the data from the sensors, and visualize if any of the sensors have odd values.
```{r}
plot(pre_fire$corrected_pm)
plot(during_fire$corrected_pm)
plot(evening_of_fire$corrected_pm)
plot(december31$corrected_pm)
plot(january1$corrected_pm)
plot(january2$corrected_pm)
```


## IDW
Inverse distance weighting interpolation is used to get a map of values across our new grid object for each time period.

```{r}
# split each day into the time periods of focus
# pre-fire period: betweeen 00:00 - 11:00 MST on 12/30/2021
pre_fire <- aggregate(dec30, by="11 hours", mean)[, "2021-12-30 00:00:00"]
# fire period (11am - 5pm)
during_fire <- aggregate(dec30[, "2021-12-30 11:00:00::2021-12-30 16:00:00"], by="6 hours", mean)
# post-fire on 12/30/2021
evening_of_fire <- aggregate(dec30[, "2021-12-30 16:00:00::2021-12-31 00:00:00"], by="8 hours", mean)
# dec 31st
december31 <- aggregate(dec31, by="day", mean)
# january 1st
january1 <- aggregate(jan1, by="day", mean)
# january 2nd
january2 <- aggregate(jan2, by="day", mean)

periods <- c(pre_fire, during_fire, evening_of_fire, december31, january1, january2)
```


```{r}
pre_fire.idw <- idw(corrected_pm~1, pre_fire[!is.na(pre_fire$corrected_pm),], grd)
spplot(pre_fire.idw[,1], main="Pre-Fire Period on 12/30")

during_fire.idw <- idw(corrected_pm~1, during_fire[!is.na(during_fire$corrected_pm),], grd)
spplot(during_fire.idw[,1], main="During Fire on 12/30")

evening_of_fire.idw <- idw(corrected_pm~1, evening_of_fire[!is.na(evening_of_fire$corrected_pm),], grd)
spplot(evening_of_fire.idw[,1], main="After Fire on 12/30")

december31.idw <- idw(corrected_pm~1, december31[!is.na(december31$corrected_pm),], grd)
spplot(december31.idw[,1], main="December 31st")

january1.idw <- idw(corrected_pm~1, january1[!is.na(january1$corrected_pm),], grd)
spplot(january1.idw[,1], main="January 1st")

january2.idw <- idw(corrected_pm~1, january2[!is.na(january2$corrected_pm),], grd)
spplot(january2.idw[,1], main="January 2nd")
```

Let's make the maps easier to read. We use the EPA AQI mapping standards for these and create plots that have consistent legends.
```{r}
aqi_colors <- c("#00e400",

plot_idw(evening_of_fire.idw, "Evening of fire IDW")
plot_idw(december31.idw, "December 31st IDW")
plot_idw(january1.idw, "January 1st IDW")
plot_idw(january2.idw, "January 2nd IDW")
```

Now we take the above plots & plot them as rasters to clear up any visual confusion.
```{r}
r_grd <- raster(grd, nrows=50, ncols=49) # creating a 50x50 object gives some weird visuals

plot_idw_raster <- function(idw, title) {
  r <- raster::rasterize(idw, r_grd, field="var1.pred")
  extent(r) <- st_bbox(all_bounds)
  r_df <- r %>%
    rasterToPoints() %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    mutate(cuts = cut(layer, breaks=c(0, 12.0, 35.4, 55.4, 150.4, 250.4), na.omit=T))
  
  return(ggplot() +
          geom_tile(data=r_df, aes(x=x, y=y, fill=cuts))+
          scale_fill_manual(values=aqi_colors, labels=aqi_labels, name="PM2.5 (µg/m^3)", drop=FALSE) +
          geom_sf(data=marshall_fire$geometry, col="gray20", alpha=0.1) +
          ggtitle(title))
}

plot_idw_raster(pre_fire.idw, "Pre Fire IDW")
plot_idw_raster(during_fire.idw, "During Fire IDW")
plot_idw_raster(evening_of_fire.idw, "Evening of fire IDW")
plot_idw_raster(december31.idw, "December 31st IDW")
plot_idw_raster(january1.idw, "January 1st IDW")
plot_idw_raster(january2.idw, "January 2nd IDW")
```

### Export smoke affected area
```{r}
r <- raster::rasterize(during_fire.idw, r_grd, field="var1.pred")
extent(r) <- st_bbox(all_bounds)
r[r < 12] <- NA
writeRaster(r, "../GIS_inputs_destruction_fireboundary/smoke_affected.tiff", overwrite=TRUE)
```


### Cross Validation
Using leave-one-out cross validation to get residuals for the sensors for each time period. Each sensor is left out once, then the average residual is calculated from the other 37 times the model is created.
```{r}
pre_fire.idw_cv <- krige.cv(corrected_pm~1, pre_fire[!is.na(pre_fire$corrected_pm),], nfold=38)
pre_fire.idw_sd <- sd(pre_fire.idw_cv$residual)
paste("Pre fire standard deviation:", pre_fire.idw_sd)
spplot(pre_fire.idw_cv, main="Pre-Fire Period on 12/30")
pre_fire.idw_cv$zscore <- pre_fire.idw_cv$residual / pre_fire.idw_sd

during_fire.idw_cv <- krige.cv(corrected_pm~1, during_fire[!is.na(during_fire$corrected_pm),], nfold=38)
during_fire.idw_sd <- sd(during_fire.idw_cv$residual)
paste("During fire standard deviation:", during_fire.idw_sd)
spplot(during_fire.idw_cv, main="During Fire on 12/30")
during_fire.idw_cv$zscore <- during_fire.idw_cv$residual / during_fire.idw_sd

evening_of_fire.idw_cv <- krige.cv(corrected_pm~1, evening_of_fire[!is.na(evening_of_fire$corrected_pm),], nfold=38)
evening_of_fire.idw_sd <- sd(evening_of_fire.idw_cv$residual)
paste("Evening of fire standard deviation:", evening_of_fire.idw_sd)
spplot(evening_of_fire.idw_cv, main="After Fire on 12/30")
evening_of_fire.idw_cv$zscore <- evening_of_fire.idw_cv$residual / evening_of_fire.idw_sd

december31.idw_cv <- krige.cv(corrected_pm~1, december31[!is.na(december31$corrected_pm),], nfold=38)
december31.idw_sd <- sd(december31.idw_cv$residual)
paste("December 31st standard deviation:", december31.idw_sd)
spplot(december31.idw_cv, main="December 31st")
december31.idw_cv$zscore <- december31.idw_cv$residual / december31.idw_sd

january1.idw_cv <- krige.cv(corrected_pm~1, january1[!is.na(january1$corrected_pm),], nfold=38)
january1.idw_sd <- sd(january1.idw_cv$residual)
paste("January 1 standard deviation:", january1.idw_sd)
spplot(january1.idw_cv, main="January 1st")
january1.idw_cv$zscore <- january1.idw_cv$residual / january1.idw_sd

january2.idw_cv <- krige.cv(corrected_pm~1, january2[!is.na(january2$corrected_pm),], nfold=38)
january2.idw_sd <- sd(january2.idw_cv$residual)
paste("January 2 standard deviation:", january2.idw_sd)
spplot(january1.idw_cv, main="January 2nd")
january2.idw_cv$zscore <- january2.idw_cv$residual / january2.idw_sd
```

Plotting these residuals & normalizing them to z-scores for easier visual comparison.
```{r}
plot_idw_resid <- function(idw.cv, title) {
  return(ggplot(all_bounds) +
  geom_sf(fill="#FbFbFb", color="gray") + 
  geom_sf(data=marshall_fire$geometry, col="red", alpha=0.1) +
  geom_sf(data=st_as_sf(idw.cv), aes(fill=residual), color="black", shape=21, size=2) +
  scale_color_gradient2(aesthetics="fill") +
  ggtitle(title))
}

plot_idw_resid_zscore <- function(idw.cv, title) {
  return(ggplot(all_bounds) +
  geom_sf(fill="#FbFbFb", color="gray") + 
  geom_sf(data=marshall_fire$geometry, col="red", alpha=0.1) +
  geom_sf(data=st_as_sf(idw.cv), aes(fill=zscore), color="black", shape=21, size=2) +
  scale_color_gradient2(aesthetics="fill") +
  ggtitle(title))
}

plot_idw_resid(pre_fire.idw_cv, "Pre-Fire Residuals")
plot_idw_resid(during_fire.idw_cv, "During Fire Residuals")
plot_idw_resid(evening_of_fire.idw_cv, "After Fire Residuals")
plot_idw_resid(december31.idw_cv, "December 31st Residuals")
plot_idw_resid(january1.idw_cv, "January 1st Residuals")
plot_idw_resid(january2.idw_cv, "January 2nd Residuals")

plot_idw_resid_zscore(pre_fire.idw_cv, "Pre-Fire Residual Z-Scores")
plot_idw_resid_zscore(during_fire.idw_cv, "During Fire Residual Z-Scores")
plot_idw_resid_zscore(evening_of_fire.idw_cv, "After Fire Residual Z-Scores")
plot_idw_resid_zscore(december31.idw_cv, "December 31st Residual Z-Scores")
plot_idw_resid_zscore(january1.idw_cv, "January 1st Residual Z-Scores")
plot_idw_resid_zscore(january2.idw_cv, "January 2nd Residual Z-Scores")
```

Trying to plot each map with the residuals next to it, however these just look messy.
```{r}
plot_idw_cv <- function(idw, idw_title, idw.cv) {
  p1 <- plot_idw(idw, idw_title)
  p2 <- plot_idw_resid(idw.cv, "Residuals")
  return(grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2))
}

plot_idw_cv(pre_fire.idw, "Pre-Fire IDW", pre_fire.idw_cv)
plot_idw_cv(during_fire.idw, "During Fire IDW", during_fire.idw_cv)
plot_idw_cv(evening_of_fire.idw, "Evening of Fire IDW", evening_of_fire.idw_cv)
plot_idw_cv(december31.idw, "December 31st IDW", december31.idw_cv)
plot_idw_cv(january1.idw, "January 1st IDW", january1.idw_cv)
plot_idw_cv(january2.idw, "January 2nd IDW", january2.idw_cv)
```


### Notes:

* Pre-fire period the residuals look fairly good, some over & underprediction in downtown Boulder
* During fire period has 1 large underprediction value, few other overpredicted near fire area
* Evening after the fire has underprediction, but not much
* December 31st has high under & over predicted values right next to each other near fire
* Same as December 31st on Jan 1st
* Same as prior 2 days
  + Something happened starting on December 31st with these two sensors? Will look into both and see how the values differ over time
```{r}
# One sensor is "Eisenhower Dr"
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$Name == "Eisenhower Dr"]["2021-12-30::2022-01-02", "corrected_pm"]))
# The other is "Purple House"
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$Name == "Purple House"]["2021-12-30::2022-01-02", "corrected_pm"]), col="red")
```

The issue is coming from the Eisenhower Dr sensor most likely, as this is the one that seems messed up by the snow. Going to see how everything looks excluding the high values for this sensor. This fed back into our analysis, and has already been accounted for in the current models.

```{r}
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$Name == "Eisenhower Dr"]["2021-12-30::2022-01-02", "corrected_pm"]) %>%
               filter(corrected_pm <= 1000))
```

Checking the sensor on the edge of the fire boundary with high residuals/z scores.
```{r}
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$Name == "ntsky"]["2021-12-30::2022-01-02", "corrected_pm"]))
```


### Looping at Hourly Timescale
We create gifs to make visualization easier, as well as looking at hourly timescales instead of the six predefined fire periods.
```{r, animation.hook="gifski", interval=1.5, results='hide'}
for (j in c(30, 31, 01, 02)) {
  if (j > 3) {
    date <- paste("2021-12-", j, sep="")
  } else {
    date <- paste("2022-01-", j, sep="")
  }
  for (i in 0:23) {
    if (i < 10) {
      i <- paste("0", i, sep="")
    }
    t <- paste(date, " ", i, ":00:00", sep="")
    i.data <- krig_data[, t]
    i.idw <- idw(corrected_pm~1, i.data[!is.na(i.data$corrected_pm),], grd)
    print(plot_idw_raster(i.idw, paste(t, "IDW")))
  }
}
```

```{r, animation.hook='gifski', interval=1.5, results='hide'}
for (j in c(30, 31, 01, 02)) {
  if (j > 3) {
    date <- paste("2021-12-", j, sep="")
  } else {
    date <- paste("2022-01-", j, sep="")
  }
  for (i in 0:23) {
    if (i < 10) {
      i <- paste("0", i, sep="")
    }
    t <- paste(date, " ", i, ":00:00", sep="")
    i.data <- krig_data[, t]
    i.idw <- idw(corrected_pm~1, i.data[!is.na(i.data$corrected_pm),], grd)
    i.idw_cv <- krige.cv(corrected_pm~1, i.data[!is.na(i.data$corrected_pm),], nfold=38)
    i.idw_sd <- sd(i.idw_cv$residual)
    i.idw_cv$zscore <- i.idw_cv$residual / i.idw_sd
    print(plot_idw_resid_zscore(i.idw_cv, paste(t, "IDW Residual Z-Scores")))
  }
}
```

# Daily Gifs Starting 1/3/2022

    print(plot_idw_raster(idw, paste(day, "IDW")))
    }
}
```

### Weird Sensor from Gif
This sensor seemed to be really skewing our results starting in April 2022. Looking at the purple air website, this sensor has 0% confidence now, with values looking to lose credibility around the start of April, so earlier all of those values were dropped. (this already fed back into the current analysis we're looking at).
```{r}
plot(daily[, "2022-04-25"]$corrected_pm) # sensor at index 29 is weird = sensor ID 102614
plot(fortify(PA_STFDF[PA_STFDF@data$ID == 102614]['2022-04', "corrected_pm"]))
# ponderosa sensor has 0% confidence on purpleair map at present date
```
